* **Query:** dont call unsubscribe if it has not been set ([88772b3](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client/commit/88772b3))

# [2.0.0](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client/compare/v1.0.0-beta.30...v2.0.0) (2018-08-17)


### Bug Fixes

* add redux dependency used in tests ([386b864](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client/commit/386b864))
* client.get query will return only 1 result ([2d496e0](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client/commit/2d496e0))


### Features

* add helpful error handling ([bb68d1b](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client/commit/bb68d1b))
* add hoc queryConnect and withClient ([c241f82](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client/commit/c241f82))
* auto update queries when receiving results ([1370773](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client/commit/1370773))

* do not bind functions inside render ([0227634](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client/commit/0227634))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* before applications had to select the
first item of the results themselves, now it is
done in the library

```diff
<Query query={client.get('doctype', 'id')}>
-  { ({ data: documents }) => {
-     const myDoc = documents[0]
+  { ({ data: myDoc }) => {
  ...
}}
/>
```
