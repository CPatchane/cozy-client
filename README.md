# cozy-client

A simple and declarative way of managing [cozy-stack](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack) API calls and resulting data.

`cozy-client` is a convenient yet powerful way to bind `cozy-stack` queries to your (p)React components â€” but you can still benefit of it if you're not using React!
